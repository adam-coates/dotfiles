Arch related dotfiles adapted from: https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles


- Current setup works on macOS so need to check paths on Linux 
    e.g. `/Users/adam/` = `/home/adam/`


- Ngram database downloaded from here: 
    [Ngram database](https://languagetool.org/download/ngram-data/)

- Current set-up for writing notes uses a mixture of the following: 
    - Native nvim spell checking
    - Vale - for grammar checking 
    - Harper - for grammar checking 
    - Ltexls - for grammar checking (and some spelling) 

- TODO: 

    - Refine the language tools setup 
        -  Using too many tools right now, I think it's best to stick to one and/ or create rules to prevent overlapping diagnostics
